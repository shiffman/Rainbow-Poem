Once upon a time there was a rainbow.
The rainbow was so colorful and great and it was very nice and graceful rainbow and never wanted to hurt or offend other rainbows. 
Actually, the rainbow loved all creatures in the world and the world beyond this world but one. 
The unicorn! 
In some senses, the rainbow also didn’t like the ponies but not as bad as the unicorns, because they are quite cute and they are so small and cuddly.
The reason that the rainbow hated the unicorns so much was that the unicorns had taken the rainbow’s registered trademark, the colors, and made them their own! How rude!!
(I’m not sure how to continue this tale. Maybe I can get some help?) :)

All the best!
