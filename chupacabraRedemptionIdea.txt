The idea would surround a chupacabra becomeing friends with a ponie or unicorn, with a sense of her wrong doings in the past.
Armed with the willingness to change, the chupacabra, 
with the help of her new friends, will make steps to redeem her goat sucking ways.
The finale, being forshadowed earlier in the story of a bungled goat sucking incident left incomplete, will have our newly reformed chupacabra
apologizing to the last goat goat victim from her past.

This story will draw strongly from akward sexualized Star Trek fan fiction from 1989-1992, 
and crude maiden limericks from medieval times. 

The movie adaptaion will be comprised of mostly Steppenwolf actors, with a possible cameo from Jeff Goldblum as the goats therapist.
