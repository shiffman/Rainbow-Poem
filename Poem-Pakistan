My Poem...........................

oh you , yes you 
dear rainbom coder
Please take care of our planet earth 
because who else would do

Try to be creative
while doing so 
and never let anyone 
tell you , you can't do

Learn something new
Teach something new
go get what you want
because even sky 
is not the limit

this is the best i can come up with in 5 minutes :)
