Pounding Head, Blinding Light;
The shrill alarm is barking;
It's morning.

You regret last night.
Why did I watch the entire season in one night?
If I stay in this bed much longer,
I will be late for work.

Eyes are heavy,
Ears are ringing;
You are trying to concentrate,
But everything is scrambled.
The clock strikes 12pm.

It's time for lunch;
You are not hungry,
but you eat a large meal anyway;
Maybe this will keep you awake?

Work is over.
You drag yourself home;
Hop in bed;
Turn your laptop on;
Repeat.
