###The Rainbow, the Unicorn and the Pony
<hr>
*<p align="center">
Today is Earth Day.  
Which is not Mars,
I love Earth Day.  
Purple rain   
Is not pink   
Is not orange either  
Blue is cold   
Green   
Indigo   
Recycle!   
Unicorn   
Yellow   
Red is hot   
These are the colors of the rainbow.   
And the unicorn.   
Dogs on the rainbow.
