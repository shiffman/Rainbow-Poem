## <center>Gratitude.</center>

<h4><center>Sometimes you travel in the dusts of this Earth
and then you find a rainbow that tells you
"Hey my friend not everything is gray".<br><br>
I did find you in your **youtube channel**
Discovering the new world of the ***open-source***
where colaboration is fuel for great travels.<br><br>
You speak with strong voice, man I'll follow you
I have so many things to learn, so...
I'll be checking these beautiful codes of yours.<br><br>
Now I'm creating here this humble poem
to say that I'm greatful to find this Repo
which is full o poets, I say cheers to all of them.</h4></center><br>
